[Forgejo v1.20.6-0](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/releases/tag/v1.20.6-0) was released 28 November 2023.

This release contains _a security fix_ related to permissions enforcement of API endpoints.

### Recommended Action

We _strongly recommend_ that all Forgejo installations are upgraded to the latest version as soon as possible.

### API and web endpoint vulnerable to manually crafted identifiers

See the [Forgejo v1.20.5-1 blog post](https://forgejo.org/2023-11-release-v1-20-5-1/#api-and-web-endpoint-vulnerable-to-manually-crafted-identifiers) for
a detailed explanation on this kind of vulnerability.

- get the public key of a user
- get a release or a release attachment
- get OAuth2 applications (except for the secret)

Fixes were written for the vulnerable endpoints but not thoroughly tested.

### Reminder of responsible disclosure

[Forgejo v1.20.5-1](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/releases/tag/v1.20.5-1) was released 25 November 2023
after [a 30-day embargo](https://forgejo.org/2023-11-release-v1-20-5-1/#responsible-disclosure-to-gitea)
that gave enough time to Gogs, Gitea and Forgejo
to prepare and publish a patch release on 25 November 2025.

The complete list of identified vulnerabilities was communicated by
the Forgejo security team to Gitea on 5 November 2023 and the final
version of the patch fixing all of them was sent on 24 November
2023, via encrypted email. In addition, two PRs (for
[v1.20](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/28211) and
[v1.21](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/28212)) were sent to
Gitea on 25 November 2023 prior to the announcement of the Forgejo
release to help fast track a stable point release.

On 25 November 2023, shortly after the release, additional vulnerabilities were [revealed
publicly](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/28213) in contradiction with the
[Gitea](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/blob/763938e889c233e82a1a046010b9d332abaa833f/SECURITY.md#reporting-a-vulnerability) and
[Forgejo](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/src/branch/forgejo/CONTRIBUTING.md) security policies
as well as the [general principles of responsible disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_vulnerability_disclosure).

This unfortunate incident forced the immediate preparation of this
Forgejo patch release. With no advance warning it only allowed for limited testing
and there is a non negligible risk of a regression.

In such a situation the Forgejo admins and users are suffering the
consequences, either because they are left unecessarily exposed to
publicly known vulnerabilities or because their instance may run into
regressions due to insufficient preparation time and testing.

If you discover a new vulnerability, you are **urged to not reveal it
publicly** but to [send an encrypted email](https://forgejo.org/.well-known/security.txt) to security@forgejo.org so
this situation does not happen again.
