[Forgejo v1.21.6-0](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/releases/tag/v1.21.6-0) was released 22 February 2024.

This release contains _a security fix_ related to [Cross-site scripting (XSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting)
vulnerabilities that can be exploited by registered Forgejo users.

### Recommended Action

We _strongly recommend_ that all Forgejo installations are upgraded to the latest version as soon as possible.

### Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability

The [Cross-site scripting (XSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting) vulnerabilities
can be exploited by a registered Forgejo user.

In some situations where a repository or user name contains HTML scripts, those values are not always properly escaped, thus leading to an XSS attack. For instance when:

- [Migrating a repository](https://docs.codeberg.org/advanced/migrating-repos/)
- [Publishing content in the wiki](https://forgejo.org/docs/v1.21/user/wiki/)
- [Creating a repository on first push](https://forgejo.org/docs/v1.21/user/push-to-create/)

It allows the attacker to inject a
[client-side script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client-side_script)
targetting visitors browsing a repository being migrated, the repository settings or the wiki. Note that the repository settings are only visible to repository admins.

### Responsible disclosure to Gitea

On 22 January 2024, the Forgejo security team identified multiple
Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities could be exploited by
registered Forgejo users, and the Gitea security team was notified. A
30-day embargo was requested, after which a patch to the v1.21 point
release could be published.

On 14 February 2024, Gitea [published a pull
request](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/29165) that fixes the
vulnerability, before the end of the requested embargo. It is embedded
in a large refactor and not labeled to be security related but to a
trained eye, this does catch attention.

On 17 February 2024, the Gitea security team privately sent a patch
that fixes an additional XSS vulnerability.
